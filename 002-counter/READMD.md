# Counter

This is a simple counter that has been implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a great project for beginner web developers who want to learn how to use these three technologies together.

### Usage

The counter is extremely simple to use. Once you have opened the HTML file in your web browser, click on the "Decrease", "Reset", and "Increase" buttons to modify the count. The count will be displayed in the center of the screen, and will change color depending on whether it is negative, zero or positive. You can also click on the "Light" button to toggle the light mode, which changes the background color and the text color of the counter.

### Implementation

The implementation of the counter is quite straightforward. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the page, including the buttons and the counter. The CSS file defines the styles for the various elements of the page, such as the font, the colors, and the layout. Finally, the JavaScript file contains the logic for the counter, including the event listeners for the buttons and the mode button, as well as the functions that update the count and the colors.

### Acknowledgements

The implementation of the counter was inspired by the **[JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)** tutorial series by Wes Bos. This project is a great example of how you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple and effective web application that is both fun to use and easy to understand.
