# Color Flipper

This is a JavaScript and CSS implementation of a color flipper web application. The application allows users to generate random colors and copy the corresponding hex codes to the clipboard. The CSS file provides the styling for the web application.

### Usage

To use the color flipper, simply click the "Change Color" button to generate a new set of colors. Click on any of the color boxes to copy the corresponding hex code to the clipboard. A toast message will appear to confirm that the hex code has been copied.

### Implementation

The JavaScript code consists of several functions that handle the generation of random hex colors, the conversion of hex colors to RGB, the determination of whether a color is dark or light, and the copying of hex codes to the clipboard. The "updateBackgroundColor" function is called when the "Change Color" button is clicked, and it updates the background colors and text colors of each color box.

The CSS file provides the styling for the web application, including the colors and layout of the color boxes, the styling of the "Change Color" button, and the appearance of the toast message.

### Installation

To use this code snippet, simply download the code and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
To modify the code, you can edit the `script.js` and `style.css` files in your preferred code editor.
